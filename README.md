# Supervised Machine Learning
This contains two parts:
* Code (from scratch) for popular supervised learning algorithms. They are listed below in alphabetic order:
  * Decision Trees (Classification and Regression)
  * Fourier Basis Regression in one Dimension
  * K-Nearsest Neighbours (Classification and Regression)
  * Lasso Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Linear Discriminant Analysis 
  * Neural Network (binray Classification)
  * Ridge Regression
  * Support Vector Machine (Regression)
  
* Document detailing mathematics behind the above listed supervised algorithms 

Here are a set of images where we use a few basic datasets to see how the algorithms work.

* [K-nearest Neighbours](Results/KNN.png)
